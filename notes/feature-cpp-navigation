Italicize overridden method declarations/definitions.

Add ability to navigate from an override to the method it overrode.

(Also: add ability to jump from a definition to its lone declaration.)

Maybe it'd be cool to allow jumping from an overridden method to all of its
overrides?

There's a common pattern of using a pair of classes, e.g. IFoo and FooImpl,
which allows using Foo without seeing Foo's implementation.  Suppose we have
this code:
   struct IFoo           { virtual void bar() = 0; }
   struct FooImpl : IFoo { void bar(); }
When looking at either a call to IFoo::bar() or the implementation of
FooImpl::bar(), it is useful to see defs/refs of the other method.

It might also be nice if browsing cross-references on a class Foo showed a
call to Foo's constructor, but clicking on the constructor call still took
me to the constructor rather than Foo.  (But maybe right-clicking the
constructor call would show both the "Foo" and "Foo::Foo(...)" symbols.)

This stuff is C++-specific, I think.  I still have a vague goal of making the
GUI language-agnostic.  I wonder if these features can be added while preserving
this goal.  The goal is probably unrealistic until other languages are
supported.
