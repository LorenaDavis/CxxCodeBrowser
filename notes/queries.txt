There will be four kinds of windows for showing lists of things:
 * Def: Symbol definitions
 * Sym: Symbols
 * Path: Files
 * Ref: References of a symbol


Search
------

The Def, Sym, and Path windows will have a text box for filtering results.

Ctrl-F may eventually do an incremental search in the windows, but not
currently.


Selection
---------

In all windows, no item will be selected by default, and pressing the Down key
should select the first item.

In the Def, Path, and Ref windows, selecting an item navigates to the 
corresponding location.  In the Symb window, selecting an item has no effect,
but "activating" it (i.e. Enter or double-click) opens the Ref window for that
symbol.


Appearance
----------

The Ref window has three columns -- File, Line, and Type.  Sorting by File or
by Type is useful, and can be done by clicking a column header.

Each item in the Def window should have two rows, with a thin line separating
each pair of items:

    [Symbol name]
    [Definition path, line NNN]
     ---------------------------------------------
    [Symbol name]
    [Definition path, line NNN]
     ---------------------------------------------
    ...

The part of the item text that matches the search filter should be bolded.


Filtering
---------

Goals:
 * Case-insensitive by default.  There must be some way of doing a
   case-sensitive search.  A pattern containing a capitalized letter should
   probably force a case-sensitive search.
 * A regex search mode must exist.  (e.g. The patterns "b" and "^abc$" match
   "abc", but "^b$" does not.)
    * If the regex is invalid, detect this without printing an re2 error to
      stderr, then color the input box's text red.  Don't attempt to filter
      the items using the regex.
 * Ideally, as the filter pattern was typed, the results would incrementally
   become more precise.  With the existing filtering language, the results
   initially include everything, then nothing, then just the items matching
   the completed pattern.
 * When a selected item disappears from the filter results, no other item 
   should become selected.


Ideas:
 * Split filter into space-separated words.  Allow any characters before and
   after each word:
       get foo    =>  get.*foo
       get foo(   =>  get.*foo\(
       get foo (  =>  get.*foo.*\(
 * Try sticking to plain regexs at first.
